# Research Copilot

This project is a Streamlit app that serves as an AI-powered assistant for summarizing and interacting with research papers. The assistant, built with LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-4, provides summaries, definitions for complex terms, examples, key points, and a conversational Q&A interface to help users better understand academic papers in minutes.

## Features
**Section Summarization:** Breaks down papers into sections like Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Results, and Conclusion, summarizing each part for a quick overview.

**Terminology Definitions:** Extracts and explains complex terminology to make papers accessible.

**Key Notes:** Highlights the main points of the research paper.


**Conversational Q&A:** Engage in a chat-like conversation with the assistant for follow-up questions and deeper insights.

**Memory-Enabled Interaction:** Retains conversation context for natural, coherent responses across multiple questions.

## Technologies Used:

**LangChain:** For building the conversational chain with memory, using LLMChain and ConversationChain.

**Streamlit:** Simple web app framework to display summaries, definitions, and the conversational chatbot interface.

**OpenAI's GPT-4o:** The language model behind the chatbotâ€™s responses and paper processing tasks.
